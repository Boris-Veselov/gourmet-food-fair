# description

A web application for an upcoming three-day food event. The application needs to be deployed and it needs to perform fast, especially on mobile. 

Google's Lighthouse web auditing tool will be used to provide insight into how an application is performing, including both what it's doing well and what might be hindering performance.

The app needs to be turned into a PWA - Progressive Web Application. PWAs resemble native mobile apps and allow users to interact with the application even when there is no internet connection or cell service. For the food fair app, this means that event attendees would be able to access data such as schedules and vendor locations without worrying about having a cell signal or WiFi.
